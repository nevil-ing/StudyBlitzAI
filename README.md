Nevi Student Virtual Assistant with Gemini Integration
Introduction

Students juggle numerous commitments throughout their academic journey, often struggling to maintain a healthy balance between coursework, study time, and knowledge acquisition. Extensive research and independent learning, while crucial for academic growth, can significantly eat into valuable time. This project presents Nevi, a student virtual assistant powered by the Gemini API, designed to address these challenges by offering a convenient and efficient solution for exam preparation and academic inquiries.
